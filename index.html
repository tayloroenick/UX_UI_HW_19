                <h1>My name is Taylor Oenick, and I am a UI/UX Designer specializing in visual design. </h1>
           </div> 
           
            <p>I enjoy solving digital problems with intuitive and impactful design thinking and processes. </p>
            <p> I believe I can bring something different to the table than most traditional designers, because of my background in Civil & Environmental Engineering, Sustainable Design and Art.</p>
            <p>Good design, much like a well-engineered bridge or a compelling painting, asks "how can I extend beyond function, and into beauty?"</p> 
            <p>Design, at its core, is also problem solving. I approach all work with an equally analytical and creative mind with an intense attention to detail.</p>
            <P>I like to approach typical design processes with an emphasis on accessibility: Have we considered everyone's needs in this design? How does this solve our different users' problems better than other potential solutions?</P>

                    <p>Problem Statement: Without an efficient means of coordinating group travel, all of the decision making and logistical work falls to just a few of the travel companions. </p>
                    <p>Outcome: Plannr helps groups traveling together plan their itinerary, budget, and centralize their travel information and solve communication issues impartially and efficiently.</p>

                    <h5>Clean. Clear. Concious.</h5>
                    <p>Problem Statement: With the overwhelming amount of skincare products and information available, people often rely on recommendations, brands they have“heard of” or what they have always done. But what is right for some is not right for others, and good enough isn't the best!</p>
                    <p>Outcome: Clarity provides users with narrowed options, within their specific skin needs, constraints and goals, for clean and simple products from sustainable and cruelty-free brands. </p>

                    <h5>With a Giving Heart</h5>
                    <p>Problem Statement: As FH4Ks website existed, people were wary of their credibility and impact, and unable to pinpoint what it is exactly they do and how they do it. </p>
                    <p>Outcome: Through focusing the content of the website on FH4Ks directive, history and impact, as well as making getting involved as easy as possible, we were able to highlight only the pertinent information with a clear and encouraging call to action. </p>
